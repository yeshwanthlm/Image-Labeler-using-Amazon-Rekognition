### Overview of Project ☁️
In this project, we will be building an image labels generator, using Amazon Rekognition. This is going to be a fun one. Once built, it will be able to recognize and label images. For example, if you have a photo of a cat, Amazon Recognition will be able to identify what it is, and label the image as a cat.

### Steps to be performed:
We'll be going through the following steps.

* Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket: image-labeler-using-amazon-rekognition-bucket
* Uploading images to the S3 Bucket
* Installing configuring the AWS Command line interface (CLI)
* Importing libraries
* Adding detect_labels function
* Adding main function
* Running your python file

### Services Used 🛠
* Amazon S3: For storing the images in the process of generating labels.
* Amazon Rekognition: To analyse images and generate image labels.
* AWS CLI: Interacting with AWS services through command line interface(CLI).

### Estimated Time & Cost ⚙️
